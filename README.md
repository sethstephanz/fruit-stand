Congratulations! You've been promoted to head manager of the Fruit Stand! 

From week to week, you'll have to keep track of a couple of things to keep the fruit stand running smoothly. At the beginning of each week, you'll need to review price and demand projections, review the stand's inventory, and react to any unforseen events that may impact the fruit stand's revenue stream. Good luck!
